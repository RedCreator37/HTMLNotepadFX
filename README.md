# HTMLNotepadFX ![][versionBadge] ![][licenseBadge]

HTMLNotepadFX is a simple JavaFX-based HTML editor app (JavaFX HTMLEditor wrapped in a nice window).

*This is the first program I put on GitHub.*
*I hope that you understand that some things aren't done perfectly.*
*Contributions are welcome :D*

## Features

A simple program for editing HTML pages:

- Apply basic HTML and CSS formatting, insert an image, hyperlinks...
- View, export and print the HTML page and its source code
- WYSIWYG formatting
- Some fancy extras (make the window semi-transparent...)

## Known Bugs

Things that don't work as expected (yet). These should get fixed soon.

- Printing on macOS (fails to open the print dialog for some reason)

## To Do

Stuff that could have been added / done better:

- A simple way to deploy HTML pages to a web server
- Improved UI (some progress has been made with "experimental UI" but it's still way from looking great)
- Use of resource bundles or something else that'll allow the UI to be translated to other languages easily

Early development versions are in the *dev-html* branch.
