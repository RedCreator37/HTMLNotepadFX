# Notepad ![][licenseBadge] ![][versionBadge]

This is a simple JavaFX notepad app (similar to Windows Notepad with some extra features).

*This is the first program I put on GitHub and I'm more of a beginner in Java.*
*I hope that you understand that some things aren't done perfectly.*
*PRs are welcome ;)*

## Features

Mostly just notepad stuff:

- Edit text files
- Print text files
- Some fancy other features...

## What's not working

These are the things that don't work as expected (yet):

- Search (selecting doesn't work as expected)
- Printing on macOS (not sure about this one, it fails to open the print dialog for some reason)

## Requirements
Notepad is built on Java 11 and JavaFX. You'll have to manually install JavaFX since it's no longer bundled with JDK.
