# HTMLNotepadFX ![][versionBadge] ![][licenseBadge]

HTMLNotepadFX is an HTML editor app built on the [JavaFX framework](https://openjfx.io).

## Features

All basic things one would expect from an HTML editor:

- Apply HTML and CSS formatting, insert an image, hyperlinks...
- View, export and print HTML files and their source code
- WYSIWYG formatting
- Some fancy extras (make the window transparent, disable mouse cursor, ...)

## Known Bugs

These are the things that don't work as expected (yet):

- Printing on macOS (fails to open the print dialog)

## To Do

- A simple way to deploy HTML pages to a web server
- Revamped UI (some progress has been made, but it's still far from looking great)
- Localization support (either with Resource Bundles or something else)

Development versions are in the [*dev-html*](https://github.com/RedCreator37/HTMLNotepadFX/tree/dev-html) branch.
